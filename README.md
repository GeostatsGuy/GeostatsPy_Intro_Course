# Introduction to [GeostatsPy](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPy) Course

Open source Python package for Spatial / Subsurface Data Analytics 

#### Course Objectives:

You will gain:
* knowledge concerning basics of the use of the GeostatsPy package for spatial/subsurface data analytics and geostatistics. 

* experience with a variety of practical spatial data analytics / geostatistics workflows in Python

#### Course Agenda
* Introduction: objectives, plan
* Variogram Calculation - quantifying spatial continuity
* Variogram Modeling - formulating valide spatial continuity models
* Kriging - spatial estimation
* Conclusions

#### The Instructor:

### Michael Pyrcz, Associate Professor, University of Texas at Austin 
*Novel Data Analytics, Geostatistics and Machine Learning Subsurface Solutions*

With over 17 years of experience in subsurface consulting, research and development, Michael has returned to academia driven by his passion for teaching and enthusiasm for enhancing engineers' and geoscientists' impact in subsurface resource development.

#### Want to Work Together?

I hope that this is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate.

* Want to invite me to visit your company for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and consulting, I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* Interested in partnering, supporting my graduate student research or my Subsurface Data Analytics and Machine Learning consortium (co-PIs including Profs. Foster, Torres-Verdin and van Oort)? My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!
